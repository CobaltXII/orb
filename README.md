# Orb

![Alt text](https://github.com/CobaltXII/orb/blob/master/img/orb_3.png?raw=true)

## Summary

Orb started out as a weekend project, but then got a little bigger. It currently supports diffuse lighting, specular lighting, recursion, reflection, refraction, procedural environments, procedural texturing, supersampling, and materials. More features will be added soon!

## Compiling

I use this script

```bash
clang++ orb.cpp -o orb -std=c++11 -Ofast && ./orb
```
